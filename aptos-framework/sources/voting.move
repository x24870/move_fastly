/**
 * This is the general Voting module that can be used as part of a DAO Governance. Voting is designed to be used by
 * standalone governance modules, who has full control over the voting flow and is responsible for voting power
 * calculation and including proper capabilities when creating the proposal so resolution can go through.
 * On-chain governance of the Aptos network also uses Voting.
 *
 * The voting flow:
 * 1. The Voting module can be deployed at a known address (e.g. 0x1 for Aptos on-chain governance)
 * 2. The governance module, e.g. AptosGovernance, can be deployed later and define a GovernanceProposal resource type
 * that can also contain other information such as Capability resource for authorization.
 * 3. The governance module's owner can then register the ProposalType with Voting. This also hosts the proposal list
 * (forum) on the calling account.
 * 4. A proposer, through the governance module, can call Voting::create_proposal to create a proposal. create_proposal
 * cannot be called directly not through the governance module. A script hash of the resolution script that can later
 * be called to execute the proposal is required.
 * 5. A voter, through the governance module, can call Voting::vote on a proposal. vote requires passing a &ProposalType
 * and thus only the governance module that registers ProposalType can call vote.
 * 6. Once the proposal's expiration time has passed and more than the defined threshold has voted yes on the proposal,
 * anyone can call resolve which returns the content of the proposal (of type ProposalType) that can be used to execute.
 * 7. Only the resolution script with the same script hash specified in the proposal can call Voting::resolve as part of
 * the resolution process.
